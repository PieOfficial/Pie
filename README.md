# ***Pie***
Pie is a build system designed for power, speed, and productivity. A general purpose build tool that combines ease of use with high efficiency. It is very easy to use syntactically, and also provides great build times! Pie is free and open-source and is written in C++ and C. It is designed to be easy to use, extensible, and fast.

##  Building
Pie can only be built and run on Windows at the moment.
For compiling the source, you would require:
- make
- GNU G++ (>= 11.2.0)

Follow these steps to compile:
1. Clone the github Pie repository with the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PieOfficial/Pie Pie --recursive
   ``` 
   Make sure you use the *--recursive* flag since the code has some submodule dependencies
    
2. Move into the *Pie* directory using 

        cd Pie
3. Now we will compile the source code using *make*. If your *g++* points to one of the suitable compilers listed above the simply run 
    
        make
